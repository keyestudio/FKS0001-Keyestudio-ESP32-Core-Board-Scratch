## **Project 1: LED Blinking**

###  **1. Description**

LED blinking is a simple project designed for starters. You only need to install an LED on Arduino board and upload the code on Arduino IDE. This project reinforces the learning of Arduino conceptual framework and using methods for starters. 

###  **2. Working Principle**

![](./media/led-1684551913165-2.png)

**LED:** Generally speaking, limited IO ports of output current may cause low brightness of LED, so a NPN triode (Q2) is applied in circuit as a switch. In this case, the LED will light up if the base(pin 1) of triode is at a high level. On the contrary, LED goes off when the base is at low. 

**Triode switch:** Briefly, LED lights up when the base(pin 1) is at a high level. In the same breath, the collector(pin 3) and emitter(pin 2) are connected, and then VCC passes through a current-limiting resistor to LED and finally to GND, which forms a circuit. On the contrary, LED goes off when the base is at low. In this circumstance, the collector and emitter are disconnected  and the LED lights off.

## **Project 2: Breathing LED**

### **1. Description**

Arduino breathing led utilizes on-board programmable PWM to output analog waveform. After powering on, LED brightness can be adjusted through duty cycle of the waveform to eventually realize the effect of breathing led. 
In this way, ambient light can be simulated by changing LED brightness over time. Also, breathing led can form a colorful mini light to construct a tranquil and warm environment.

### **2. What is PWM?**

PWM controls analog output via digital means, which is able to adjust duty cycle of the wave (a signal circularly shifting between high level and low level).

For Arduino, digital ports of voltage output are LOW and HIGH, which respectively correspond to 0V and 5V. Generally, we define LOW as 0 and HIGH as 1. Arduino will output 500 signals of 0 or 1 within 1s. If they are "1", 5V will be output. Oppositely, if they are all 0, the output will be 0V. Or if they are 010101010101..., the average output will be 2.5V. 

In other words, output ratio of 0 and 1 affects the voltage value, the more 0 and 1 signals are output per unit time, the more accurate the control will be.

## **Project 5：Rainbow Ambient Light**

### **1. Description**

2812RGB LED is a programable colorful dreamy light, whose color, brightness and rhythm are adjustable.  This rainbow ambient light can be used as a dynamic decoration at will. Or you may control it to "dance with music". Importantly, it can be improved as an alarm. Its built-in sensor detects the ambient surroundings to warn users by changing  its color, brightness and rhythm.

### **2. Working Principle**

![image-20230314194251127](./media/image-20230314194251127.png)

The data protocol adopts communication mode of single-line return-to-zero code. After the pixel is reset on power, DIN terminal receives data from the controller. The firstly arriving 24bit data will be extracted by the first pixel and be sent to the inner data register. 

Remaining data will be amplified by an amplification circuit and be transmitted through DOUT port to the next cascaded pixel. 
Being transmitted through pixels, the signal decreases 24bit each time. 

Besides, The pixel adopts automatic shaping and forwarding technology, insomuch that the cascade number of the pixel is only limited by the signal transmission speed.

### **2. Working Principle**

![image-20230317144940800](./media/image-20230317144940800.png)

An active buzzer integrates a multi-vibrator, so it makes sound only via DC voltage. Pin 1 of the buzzer connects to VCC and pin 2 is controlled by a triode. When a high level is provided for the base (pin 1) of the triode, its collector (pin 3) and emitter (pin 2) link to GND, and then the buzzer emits sound. 
Oppositely, if we offer a low level to the base, the rest of pins will be disconnected, so the buzzer will remain quiet.

![](./media/20230420085055.png)

### **6. Code Explanation**

1. Set the CS pin. In the code, DIN is fixed to io23 and SLK to io18, while CS pin is optional. For convient wiring, we select io15.

   ![](./media/image-20230420085552242.png)

2. Draw pixels. This code block will light up or turn off pixels on the dot matrix by axis x and y, with red for on and black for off.

![image-20230318120021624](./media/image-20230318120021624.png)

3. Draw line. Locate the line by two group of coordinate points, also with red for on and black for off. 

![image-20230318120145212](./media/image-20230318120145212.png)

4. Show characters. We have add character libraries so you only need to type a letter to display it on the dot matrix. Besides, it must be used cooperatively with a "rotation 180°" block. 

  ![image-20230318130321293](./media/image-20230318130321293.png)

5. Show numbers. Similarly, you only need to type a number to display it on the dot matrix, and it also must be used cooperatively with a "rotation 180°" block. 

![image-20230318130346709](./media/image-20230318130346709.png)

6. Show scrolling character strings. Collocating a "rotation 180°" block, the specified scrolling strings will be displayed after setting its speed. 

![image-20230318130405179](./media/image-20230318130405179.png)

7. Display image. For convenience, we have already integrated some emotion icons which can be selected directly. 

![image-20230318130421059](./media/image-20230318130421059.png)

8. Display fill colors. You may set to black (LED goes off) or red(LED lights up).

![image-20230318130444192](./media/image-20230318130444192.png)

9. Refresh the display. The dot matrix must be refreshed if it displays something. Or else, an error may occur.

![image-20230318130500471](./media/image-20230318130500471.png)

10. Set the brightness. You can lower the brightness when debugging to avoid offending to your eyes.

![image-20230318133821875](./media/image-20230318133821875.png)

11. Set rotation angles. For high compatibility with more code, some data and icons need a rotation with the avoidence of inverted display.  That is why a "rotation 180°" block is necessary in codes.

## **Project 12: Servo**

### **1. Description**
This servo features high performance and high precision with a maximum rotation angle of 180°. Weighting only 9g, it is perfectly suitable for any mini device in multiple occasions. What's more, it enjoys short startup time, low noise and strong stability.

### **2.  Working Principle**

**Angle range:** 180° (360°, 180° and 90°)

**Drive voltage:** 3.3V or 5V

**Pin:** Three wires

![wps1](./media/wps1.png)

**GND:** Grounded(brown)

**VCC:** A red pin that connects to a +5v (3.3V) power

**S:** A orange signal pin that controlled via PWM signal

![wps2(1)(1)](./media/wps2(1)(1.png)

**Control Principle**: The rotation angle is controlled via duty cycle of PWM. Theoretically, standard PWM cycle is 20ms(50Hz), so pulse width should distribute within 1ms~2ms. However, the actual pulse width reaches 0.5ms~2.5ms, which corresponds to 0°～180°. Pay attention that, for the same signal, the rotation angle may vary from servo brands. 

### **3. Wiring Diagram**

![](./media/12(1.jpg)

### **4. Test Code**

1.Drag the two basic blocks and put a "variable" block between them. Set the variable type to int, name to angle, and assign 0 as its initial value. 

![image-20230325102408697](./media/image-20230325102408697.png)

2. **Servo gradually rotates from 0° to 180°:** 

Add a repeat block and set the repeat times to 180(180 angles). Drag a "change variable" and a "servo" block and put them in the repeat one. Name the variable "angle" and select the mode "++". Set Servo PIN to IO4 and degree to the named variable. Don't forget to delay 15s.

![](./media/image-20230420103144408.png)

3. **Servo gradually rotates from 180° to 0°:** Repeat step 2, but set the variable mode to "- -".

![image-20230420103210656](./media/image-20230420103210656.png)

![](./media/12.png)

### **5.  Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, the servo starts to rotate from 0° to 180° and then from 180° to 0°.

### **6. Code Explanation**

1. Set the values of Servo. Servo pin and rotation angle can be controlled by setting parameters on this block.
   ![](./media/image-20230420103328378.png)

## **Project 13: Mini Lamp**

### **1. Description**

In this project, we are going to control a lamp via Arduino UNO and a button. When we press the button, the state of the lamp will shift(ON or OFF).



### **2. Working Principle**

![](./media/img-20230225082310-1684554940659-1.png)

When the button is released, a voltage VCC passing through R29 provides a high level for S terminal. 
When pressed, pin 1 and 3, pin 2 and 4 are connected and voltage on S1 arrives GND as a low level. At this moment, R29 avoids a short circuit between VCC and GND.



### **3. Wiring Diagram**

![13-1](./media/13-1.jpg)

### **4.  Test Code**

## **Project 17: Invasion Alarm**

### **1.  Description**
This invasion alarm system is able to detect invaders in houses or small offices and warn the host to take measures in time. 

In this project, the sensor monitors a certain area. Some device on Arduino board will trigger LED to light up and buzzer to beep for caution if a movement is detected in that zone. What's more, its sensibility is adjustable for a more accurate detection. 

Virtually, this module features practicability, easy installation and low costs. With the exception of home and office, it also applies to factories, warehouses and markets, which, to a large extent, protects property security.

### **2. Working Principle**

![](./media/por-1684554948170-3.png)

Human body(37°C) always emits infrared ray with a wavelength of 10μm, which approximates to that of the sensor detected. 
On this account, this module is able to detects human beings movement. If there is, PIR sensor outputs a high level about 3s and, it outputs a low level. 

### **3. Wiring Diagram**

The dimming lamp adjusts the brightness of LED via a potentiometer and an Arduino controller. The brightness is subject to resistance value, which can be read and adjusted by connecting the ends of the potentiometer to digital or analog pins on board. 
What's more, this system is applied to control voltage or current of other devices such as fans, bulbs and heaters. 

### **2. Working Principle**

Essentially, potentiometer is an element that can change the value of resistance. According to Ohm's law(U=I*R), the resistance affects the voltage. Our potentiometer is 10K.

In this project, the maximum resistance is 10K. The ESP32 board will equally divide the voltage of 3V into 4095 parts (3/4095=0.0007326007326. The analog voltage is obtained by multiplying the read value and 0.0007326007326.

## **Project 20: Light Pillar**

### **1.  Description**
The resistance(less than 1KΩ) of the photoresistor varies from the light, thus it can control the brightness of the dot matrix. When controlling, we connect this resistor to an analog pin on the board to monitor the change of resistance. In this way, the light automatically controls the brightness of the display. 

Besides,  the photoresistor is widely applied to our daily life. For instance, a curtain automatically opens or closes according to the outer light intensity. 

### **2. Working Principle**

![](./media/img-20230225082629-1679443973070-13-1679881978135-5.png)



When it is totally in dark, the resistance equals 0.2MΩ, and the voltage at signal terminal (point 2) approaches to 0V. The stronger the light is , the smaller the resistance and voltage will be.

## **Project 21: Sound Controlled LED**

### **1. Description**
Sound controlled LED is a device used to detect sound in a way that controls the brightness of LED, which is composed of a Arduino board and some components. It can connect to multiple sensors such as microphones. It converts sound to changing voltage signal to be received by Arduino to control the LED on and off.

### **2. Working Principle**

![image-20230315150410153](./media/image-20230315150410153.png)

When detecting a sound, the electret film in microphone vibrates, which changes the capacitance and generates a subtle change of voltage. 

Next, we make use of LM386 chip to build a proper circuit to amplify the detected sound up to 200 times, which can be adjusted by a potentiometer. Rotate it clockwise to enlarge the times. 



### **3. Wiring Diagram**

![21-1](./media/21-1.jpg)

The commonly seen corridor light is a kind of sound controlled light. Meanwhile, it also includes a photoresistor. 

Differed from that, here we establish a model that an LED is only affected by sound. When the analog volume exceeds 100, LED lights up for 2s and then goes off.

2. Add a variable block and name it as "item". Adopt a map function to convert the read sound value range from 0-4095 to 0-7, yet the hypothesis maximum value of sound is 800.

![](./media/image-20230420171810111.png)

3. Clear the display. 
4. Program a condition. If the variable item is greater than -1, the dot matrix displays (x0:0  y0:0 x1:1  y1:0) in color of red.

![image-20230330120747953](./media/image-20230330120747953.png)

5. Repeat step 4, but the judgment is whether item is greater than 0. If so, dots at (x0:1  y0:0  x1:1  y1:1) will light up. By that analogy, build code blocks referring to the following coordinates. 

6. Finally, refresh the display.

## **Project 25: Ultrasonic Rangefinder**

### **1. Description**
This ultrasonic rangefinder measures distance of obstacles by emitting sound waves and then receiving the echo. That is to say, the distance is not an immediate value, but an observed one by a theoretical calculation of time difference between emitter and receiver. 

Ultrasonic is able to detect the shape of objects, set up automatic doors and estimate flow velocity and pressure. 

What's more, it supports cooperative works with computers. As a result, the measured value can be transmitted to computers via Arduino board. 

In daily life, it is widely used for motors, servos and LEDs as well as systems(automatic navigation, control and security monitoring systems).

### **6. Knowledge Expansion**

Let's make a rangefinder. 

We display characters on LCD 1602. Program to show "Keyestudio" at (3,0) and “distance:” at (0,1) followed by the distance value at (9,1. 

When the value is smaller than 100(or 10), a residue of the third(or the second) bit still exists. Therefore, an "if" judgement is necessary to determine a certain condition.

**Wiring Diagram：**

![25-2](./media/25-2.jpg)

**Code：**

1. Drag the two basic blocks.

2. In "LCD", initialize the LCD. Drag an “LCD print” block and add character string “Keyestudio” (It also can be put out of "forever" block as this display is fixed). Add a "variable" block and set type to int and name to "distance" with an initial assignment of 0.

![](./media/image-20230421101041663.png)

3. Assign the read distance value to the variable "distance". Set the LCD to print “Distance：” and followed by the distance value (and we need calculate the front displayed characters in advance to set a cursor followed them).

![](./media/image-20230421101122088.png)

4. Build a "clear display residue" block when the number of displayed bits decrease. We firstly adopts a condition to judge whether the distance is smaller than 100(or 10. If so, a space will be printed at the residue of the third (or the second) bit to clear previous display. Lastly, don't forget to add a delay of 0.5s.

## **Project 29: IR Remote Control**
### **1. Description**

The IR remote control uses IR signal to control LED, which greatly simplifies the process of controlling LED. 



### **2. Working Principle**

![img-20230225082859](./media/img-20230225082859.png) 

In this project, we often use a carrier of about 38K for modulation. 

IR remote control system includes modulation, emitting and receiving. It sends data through modulating, which improves the transmission efficiency and reduces the power consumption.

Generally, the frequency of carrier modulation is within 30khz~60khz(usually 38kHz). The duty cycle of the square wave is 1/3, as shown below, which is decided by the 455kHz crystal oscillator on the emitting end. 
An Integer frequency division is essential for crystal oscillator at this end, and the frequency coefficient usually evaluates 12. Therefore, 455kHz÷12≈37.9kHz≈38kHz. 



**38KH carrier (complete) emitting diagram:**![img-20230225083510](./media/img-20230225083510.jpg)

**Carrier frequency:** 38KHz

**Wave length:** 940nm

**Receiving angle:** 90°

**Control distance:** 6M

### **3. Wiring Diagram**

![](./media/29-1.jpg)

### **4. Test Code**

1. Drag the two basic blocks.

2. Find and drag the "IR remote init" block from “IR Remote” and set its pin to IO19. Add a "baud rate" block from "serial" and set to 9600.

![](./media/image-20230421142044084.png)

3. Drag an "if" block and fill its condition with "Received data". Only when the IR module receives data, code blocks in "if" will execute.


![image-20230331104631171](./media/image-20230331104631171.png)

4. Drag another "if" block and set its condition to "Read the data ＞ 0". Only when this condition is satisfied, serial port starts to print data. 

   This sensor works so fast that the code may run twice or more when you are pressing control buttons. However, the second time of a same command will send out a value of 0, so a ">" block is necessary for the avoidance of duplication. 

![image-20230331105216727](./media/image-20230331105216727.png)

5. Add a "serial print" block after "then". Set to print the read data from "IR remote" module in the mode of "warp".

![image-20230331114809806](./media/image-20230331114809806.png)

6. In the end, do not forget to refresh data after execution. 

![image-20230331114824593](./media/image-20230331114824593.png)

**Complete Code:**

![](./media/29-1-1682058028871-39.png)

### **5. Test Result**

After connecting the wiring and uploading code, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. Press the button on the remote control unit, and you will see the value in hexadecimal.

![image-20230331114725348](./media/image-20230331114725348.png)

### **6. Expansion Code**

In this expansion code, we will make a light controlled by an IR remote switch. Press OK to light up the LED and press it again to turn it off. 

To realize this repeatable operation, the variable "item" is essential in the whole code. For the first time, item = 0 so codes in "else" run to assign 1 as its new value. For the second time when item = 1, however, "if" block executes to reassign to 0, alternatively.
